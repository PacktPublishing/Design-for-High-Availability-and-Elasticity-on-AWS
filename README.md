# Design for High Availability and Elasticity on AWS [Video]
This is the code repository for [Design for High Availability and Elasticity on AWS](https://www.packtpub.com/cloud-networking/design-for-high-availability-and-elasticity-on-aws-video). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
AWS Cloud Platform provides you with the ability to elastically scale your applications based on demand and build highly available application architectures that are resilient to failures and outages.
This course provides in-depth coverage of the principles of elasticity and scalability. We will be designing applications for high availability and also building loosely coupled architectures with disposable resources. You'll master auto-scaling, where we will be implementing elastic load balancers; learn how to set up auto-scaling groups with launch configurations, and scale computing resources dynamically or on a schedule. You'll learn to scale vertically and horizontally with RDS services and you'll also use Amazon DynamoDB and RedShift services. Finally, we'll go through an end-to-end example of building highly available and elastic architectures with a web application.
By the end of this course, you will have the confidence and knowledge to implement the AWS functionality and to create highly available application architectures that will have a positive effect on your organization.
